                        In addition to these core categories, identify 2-3 more categories that are highly relevant to this specific job description. Examples of additional categories include: AI/ML Development, Application of AI/ML, Deployment, Key Strengths, Areas for Focus, Communication Skills, Leadership Experience, Research Experience, etc.
                        For each identified category (both core and additional):
                        1. Assess the strength of alignment between the resume and the job description for that category.
                        2. If the resume demonstrates strong alignment with the job description for the category, precede the category with a checkmark (‚úîÔ∏è).
                        3. If the resume demonstrates poor alignment with the job description for the category, precede the category with a warning symbol (‚ö†Ô∏è).
                        4. When determining the Assessment use these guidelines: "Strong" means a very high level of compatibility, "Moderate" means some compatibility, and "Poor" means low or no compatibility.
                        Provide the output in a markdown table format. The table should have four columns: 'Category', 'Job Description Highlights', 'Resume Alignment', and 'Assessment'.

                        For the 'Job Description Highlights' column, extract key requirements and responsibilities from the job description provided. Keep the descriptions **very brief and to the point**, focusing on the essential keywords. Do not exceed 15 words.
                        For the 'Resume Alignment' column, provide a **concise and descriptive analysis** of how the resume aligns with the corresponding job description highlight. Focus on the key strengths and relevant experience. Keep the descriptions **very brief and to the point**. Do not exceed 15 words.
                        For the 'Assessment' column, use one of these values: 'Strong', 'Good', 'Moderate'.
